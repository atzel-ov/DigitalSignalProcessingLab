These are the MatLab scripts of the Digital Signal Processing lab. 

The contents are :

-> Exercise 1:
  Convolution of two discrete time signals.
  Discrete time signals and their properties in time and frequency domain.
  Sampling continuous time signals with multiple values of frequencies. 
  Shannon-Nyqusit Theorem and aliasing.
  Fourier tranform.
  Frequency spectrum of a DT signal.
   
-> Exercise 2:
  Z-tranform of a discrete time signal.
  Difference equation of an LTI system.
  Stability and casuality of an LTI system and what we conclude about the region of convergence.
  Inverse Z-tranform.
